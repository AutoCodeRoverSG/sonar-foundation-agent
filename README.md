# Sonar Foundation Agent

Sonar Foundation Agent is a coding agent for general software issues, developed at Sonar by the
former AutoCodeRover team. As of December 19th, 2025, Sonar Foundation Agent scores 79.4% on
SWE-bench Verified and 52.62% on SWE-bench, while maintaining a low average cost of $1.98 and
a high efficiency of 10.4 minutes per issue.

**Quick clarification for Sonar customers** The Sonar Foundation Agent is an internal project rather
than a commercial product. The technology behind it, however, will show up in our real offering —
the SonarQube Remediation Agent, which is currently in beta.
